# Home-Automation-System
Control Various Home Appliances With Google Assistant Using Arduino
we can control lights of our houses with our voice through Google voice assistant using Arduino. Doesn't it sounds cool to switch on and off house lights just by giving command to Google voice assistant which probably we all have in our smartphones.
We will be using a "relay module" in this project because we are dealing with AC current.
Create an IFTTT account for using Google Assistant (Register your Account with the email id associated with your Google Assistant)

Also we'll be using Adafruit.io and MIT App Inventor for the app(or a basic Blynk app)

Get Set GO!
